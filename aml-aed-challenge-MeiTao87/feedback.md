# Grade: 8.5


## Version Control: Good
All code is under version control and for each feature and each algoritm there is at least a separate commit. Final findings can be easily reproduced running an Jupyter electronic notebook.
â€‹    
## Python Code: 9
Code works as intended and intentions are indicated in code comments. Each Python module or script contains a header explaining it purpose, these headers make use of lightweight markup were necessary.
Readme present but no reference to external libraries pandas, sklearn, seaborn, matplotlib are used. 

I am very happy to see the commented out self checks to confirm whether you as a programmer understood the input and the effects of processing on the data. 


## Documentation: Good
Code works as intended and intentions are indicated in code comments. Each Python module or script contains a header explaining it purpose, these headers make use of lightweight markup were necessary.


## Machine Learning: Good

Correct application of machine learning methods for cluster analysis and classification. Parameters of the machine learning methods are varied and data is correctly split in training, validation and test data.

## Comparison of Algorithms and Features: Good

No use of ROC or Coverage plot in main file. Confusion matrices are however presented. ROC is used in the SVM assignemnt



## Feature Construction:  Excellent

Multiple feature sets are used with motivation. Frequency information is used.
Note: I don't agree that high values are noise. This could to some extent be true for EdB, but for the tract features they are highly significant deviations from broadband nosie. Not to be ignored.
